#  Air Canvas using OpenCV  

This project implements an **Air Canvas** application using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**, where you can draw on a virtual canvas by simply moving a colored object (marker) in front of your webcam. The system detects the marker color in real-time and lets you draw with different colors on the canvas without touching the screen.

##  Features  
- Real-time marker tracking using **OpenCV**.  
- Adjustable HSV range with trackbars for color detection.  
- Virtual drawing canvas with options:  
  - **Clear All** (reset the canvas).  
  - **Choose Colors**: Blue, Green, Red, Yellow.  
- Supports continuous drawing using deque-based point tracking.  
- Interactive interface showing **live tracking**, **mask**, and **canvas** windows.
